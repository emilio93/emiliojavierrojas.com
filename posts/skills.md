# Skills

* Having developed systems from the ground and mantaining them during their lifecycle I am confident in my problem solving skills.
* Learning new technologies and required ones, in fast paced enviroinments, I can assure I am mostly a self-taught person.
* Being a teamplayer and a leader when required, I believe I am happier when I have to work with people, I believe everyone has something very important to share.
